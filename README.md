# Logistic regression on homomorphically encrypted MNIST data

This zip file contains two python scripts. "vanilla.py" is plane logistic regression binary classifier. "logistic_regr_HE.py" is the homomorphically encrypted logistic regression. I have included the OpenFHE .so library file in the zip. For me personally it is needed in the project folder in order to have the OpenFHE library working.
